Create a sprint plan that breaks down the project into {num_sprints} sprints. For each sprint, define:

1. Sprint Goal: What should be achieved by the end of this sprint
2. Key Tasks: Specific tasks to be completed, with estimated complexity (Low/Medium/High)
3. Task Assignments: Which team members should work on which tasks based on their skills
4. Dependencies: Any tasks that depend on other tasks
5. Deliverables: What should be ready by the end of the sprint
6. Risks and Mitigations: Potential issues that might arise and how to address them

Your plan should be realistic, taking into account the team's size and skills. It should also follow an incremental approach, ensuring that there is a working version of the project at the end of each sprint.
