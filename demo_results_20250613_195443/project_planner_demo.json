        "core_features": [
          "**Exercise Tracking:**  Allows users to log their workouts, including type, duration, distance, calories burned, and heart rate (if supported by device).  Integration with fitness trackers is a plus.",
          "**Nutrition Logging:** Enables users to input their daily food intake, including meals, snacks, and drinks.  Provides options for manual entry or barcode scanning.  Calculates macronutrients (protein, carbs, fats) and calories.",
          "**Wellness Tips:** Delivers personalized daily or weekly wellness tips based on user data and goals (e.g., hydration reminders, stress management techniques).",
          "**Progress Visualization:** Presents user data in clear and engaging charts and graphs, showing trends in exercise, nutrition, and overall wellness.",
          "**Goal Setting:** Allows users to set personalized health goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, increased activity levels) and track their progress towards achieving them.",
          "**User Profile Management:** Secure user account creation, login, and profile management, including personal information, health data preferences, and goal settings.",
          "**Data Backup & Synchronization:** Enables users to back up their data to the cloud and synchronize it across multiple devices.",
          "**Integration with HealthKit/Google Fit (Optional):**  Connects with existing health platforms to automatically import data, reducing manual input."

        "technical": [
          "**Frontend:** React Native (cross-platform compatibility) or Flutter (similarly cross-platform)",
          "**Backend:** Node.js with Express.js (scalable and relatively easy to learn for a small team) or Firebase (simplifies backend development significantly)",
          "**Database:**  Cloud Firestore (if using Firebase) or a NoSQL database like MongoDB (if using Node.js).  A relational database like PostgreSQL is overkill for this project's scope within the timeframe.",
          "**APIs:**  Potential use of third-party APIs for nutrition information (e.g., Nutritionix, USDA FoodData Central), weather data (for wellness tips), and potentially map services if integrating location data into exercise tracking."
        ],
        "non_functional": [
          "**Performance targets:**  App should load within 3 seconds, data retrieval should be near instantaneous, and transitions between screens should be smooth.",
          "**Security considerations:**  Data encryption both in transit and at rest is crucial.  Secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., password hashing, OAuth 2.0) should be implemented.  User privacy should be a priority, adhering to relevant data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).  Regular security audits (though beyond scope for 3 weeks) should be considered for a production-ready app.",
          "**Scalability:** The initial design should accommodate a reasonable number of users, but extensive scalability features are not a priority for this short timeframe."

Display trends in exercise, nutrition, and overall wellness.\n* **Day 19-21:** Implement goal setting functionality (Frontend & Backend).  Include basic goal types (weight, activity, etc.).  Final testing and deployment preparation.\n\n\n**5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies:**\n\n| Risk                      | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy                                   |\n|---------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Insufficient Time Allocation | High   | High         | Prioritize core features, streamline development process, daily stand-ups for progress tracking. |\n| Limited Team Expertise     | Medium | Medium       | Leverage online resources, collaborate effectively, focus on achievable milestones. |\n| Data Security & Privacy Concerns | High   | Medium       | Implement robust security measures (encryption, secure storage), adhere to privacy regulations. |\n\n\n**6. Resource Allocation and Team Structure:**\n\n* **Project Manager:** Oversees the project, manages tasks, facilitates communication, and ensures timely completion.\n* **Frontend Developer:** Develops and maintains the user interface using React.\n* **Backend Developer:** Develops and maintains the backend APIs using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.\n\n\n**7. Success Criteria and Deliverables:**\n\n* **Functional App:** A fully functional mobile application with core features (exercise tracking, nutrition logging, wellness tips, progress visualization, goal setting, and user profile management).\n* **Usable Interface:** An intuitive and user-friendly interface.\n* **Data Security:** Secure storage and handling of user data.\n* **On-time Delivery:** Completion of the project within the 3-week timeframe.\n\n**Note:** This plan prioritizes core features.  Optional features like HealthKit/Google Fit integration might be considered in future iterations if time allows.  Regular communication and agile methodologies will be crucial for successful project completion."
