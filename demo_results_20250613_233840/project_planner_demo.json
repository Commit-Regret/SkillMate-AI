      "final_plan": "# Project Plan: SkillMate AI Mobile Health App\n\n**1. Project Overview and Goals:**\n\nThis project aims to develop a mobile health application for tracking exercise, nutrition, and overall wellness. The app will provide users with tools to log their activities, set goals, visualize their progress, and receive personalized wellness tips.  The goal is to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within three weeks.\n\n**2. Technical Architecture Diagram:**\n\nThe application will utilize a serverless architecture.  The frontend (React) will communicate with a Node.js/Express backend via API calls.  Data will be stored in a MongoDB database.

Regular sprint reviews and adjustments will be necessary to adapt to unforeseen challenges and maintain progress.  Daily stand-up meetings are recommended to enhance communication and collaboration. The team should use a project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello) to track tasks and progress.  Prioritization of tasks might need to be adjusted based on the actual development speed and potential roadblocks."
